    <p class="policy__text">
      We use, store and process information about you for the following general purposes:

      </li>
      <li class="policy__list-item">
        to help create and maintain a trusted and safer environment on the Platform, such as detection and prevention of actual and potential fraud and other harmful activity, conducting investigations and risk assessments, enforcing our Terms of Service and policies, and verifying the information contained of your project/job listings;
      </li>
